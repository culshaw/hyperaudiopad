1
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:07,013
Visualization is right at the heart of my own work too.

2
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:10,044
I teach global health.

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:13,023
And I know, having the data is not enough.

4
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:17,092
I have to show it in ways people both enjoy, and understand.

5
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:22,030
Now, I'm going to try something I've never done before:

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,018
animating the data in real space,

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:28,052
with a bit of technical assistance from the crew.

8
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:33,037
So, here we go: first an axis for health.

9
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:38,064
Life expectancy from 25 years to 75 years.

10
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:41,017
And down here, an axis for wealth:

11
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:46,054
Income per person: 400, 4,000, and 40,000 dollars.

12
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:50,033
So down here, is poor and sick,

13
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,090
and up here is rich and healthy.

14
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:58,052
Now I'm going to show you the world 200 years ago,

15
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:00,029
in 1810.

16
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,096
Here come all the countries:

17
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:08,009
Europe brown, Asia red, Middle East green, Africa South of the Sahara blue,

18
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:09,062
and the Americas yellow.

19
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:13,029
And the size of the country bubble shows the size of the population.

20
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:17,037
And in 1810, it was pretty crowded down there, wasn't it?

21
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:19,040
All countries were sick and poor,

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,015
life expectancy was below 40 in all countries

23
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:26,095
and only the UK  and the Netherlands were slightly better off,

24
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,055
but not much.

25
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:30,020
And now, I start the world.

26
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:36,060
The industrial revolution makes countries in Europe and elsewhere

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,057
move away from the rest,

28
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:41,043
but the colonized countries in Asia and Africa,

29
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,061
they are stuck down there.

30
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,042
And eventually, the Western countries get healthier and healthier.

31
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:51,031
And now, we slow down to show the impact

32
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,093
of the First World War

33
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:57,067
and the Spanish flu epidemic. What a catastrophe!

34
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:02,040
And now I speed up through the 1920s and the 1930s.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,004
And, in spite of the Great Depression,

36
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,088
western countries forge on

37
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:07,042
towards greater wealth and health.

38
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:09,053
Japan and some others try to follow

39
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,043
but most countries stay down here.

40
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:15,011
Now, after the tragedies of the Second World War,

41
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,051
we stop a bit to look at the world in 1948.

42
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:22,092
1948 was a great year: the war was over,

43
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:26,009
Sweden topped the medal table at the Winter Olympics,

44
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,067
and I was born.

45
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,076
But the differences between the countries of the world

46
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:32,046
was wider than ever.

47
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:36,052
The United States was in the front, Japan was catching up,

48
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,069
Brazil was way behind,

49
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,074
Iran was getting a little richer from oil  but still had short lives.

50
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,055
And the Asian giants:

51
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,094
China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia,

52
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:50,034
they were still poor and sick down here,

53
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,037
but look what is about to happen!

54
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,096
Here we go again!

55
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:57,038
In my lifetime, former colonies gained independence,

56
00:02:57,038 --> 00:03:00,018
and then finally they started to get healthier,

57
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:00,094
and healthier,

58
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,040
and healthier.

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,013
And in the 1970s, then countries in Asia and Latin America

60
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,056
started to catch up with the Western countries:

61
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:10,071
they became the emerging  economies.

62
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:12,041
Some in Africa follow,

63
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,045
some Africans were stuck in civil wars,

64
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,095
others hit by HIV.

65
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,045
And now we can see the world today,

66
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,059
in the most up-to-date statistics.

67
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:25,043
Most people today live in the middle.

68
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:28,006
But there are huge differences at the same time

69
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,023
between the better off countries and the worse off countries

70
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:34,009
and there are also huge inequalities within countries.

71
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,056
These bubbles show country averages,

72
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,012
but I can split them.

73
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:41,015
Take China, I can split it into provinces.

74
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:44,005
There goes Shanghai.

75
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:47,068
It has the same wealth and health as Italy today.

76
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:51,007
And there is the poor inland province Guizhou,

77
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,040
it's like Pakistan

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,091
and if I split it further

79
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:57,080
the rural parts are like Ghana in Africa.

80
00:03:58,073 --> 00:04:03,046
And yet, despite the enormous disparages today,

81
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,080
we have seen 200 years of remarkable progress.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,074
That huge historical gap

83
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:10,044
between the West and the Rest is now closing.

84
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:15,021
We have become an entirely new converging world,

85
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,060
and I see a clear trend into the future,

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,049
with aid, trade, green technology, and peace.

87
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,024
It's fully possible that everyone can make it

88
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:25,051
to the healthy-wealthy corner.

89
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:30,068
Well, what you've just seen in the last few minutes

90
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,060
is the story of 200 countries

91
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,016
shown over 200 hundred years and beyond.

92
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:40,019
It involved plotting 120,000 numbers.

93
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:43,000
Pretty neat, eh?
